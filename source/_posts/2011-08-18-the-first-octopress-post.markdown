#I think I got this.

So, it only took 3 successive evenings for me to finally get this to work properly. That's not at all because the framework is complicated or fiddly. It's probably just because my "hacker skillz" are sorely underdeveloped. But, I'm the kind of person that can usually figure something out given enough time and with the help of the googles. So, I got it working, and I'm kind of stoked. Octopress, and the documentation provided by it's creator, Brandon Mathis, has been extremely straightforward and simple to use. A much more pleasant experience for me than WordPress, quite frankly. Plus, I get to use all of the fancy stuff that the cool kids are using these days. 

I'm learning, though. I will continue to learn. I'm going to write about that learning process (and lots of other stuff) here at [michaelcolenso.com](http://www.michaelcolenso.com). If you're reading this in the future, and it's still the first and only post here, I've obviously been distracted by an errant shiny thing or something. My life is like that...

I'm **really** going to try and just write something every day here. 
(Yoda just appeared in a misty cloud and asked me to rewrite that sentence. "There is no try", he says. "Only do, or do not".)

I'm **really** going to just write something every day here.

So, here we go...

cheers.
