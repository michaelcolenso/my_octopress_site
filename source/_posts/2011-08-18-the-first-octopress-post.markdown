#I think I got this.

So, it only took 3 successive evenings for me to finally get this to work, properly. I don't consider that fact to be related to the complexity of octopress. It's mostly (completely) a function of my level of familiarity with all of the various tools involved. I'm learning, though. I will continue to learn. I will document that learning process here at <a href= michaelcolenso.com>.

So, here we go...

cheers.
